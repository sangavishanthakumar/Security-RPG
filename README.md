For the player, I used the asset package from [Game Endeavor](https://game-endeavor.itch.io/mystic-woods).


For the computer and floor tiles, I used [AxulArt's Basic Top-down interior](https://axulart.itch.io/axularts-basic-top-down-interior)

For the USB stick, I used [this image](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.redd.it%2F2lewn2ibreu71.png) from [this reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/PixelArt/comments/qbbfcy/usb_stick/) made by the user ANoob_.
